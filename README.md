# 2048

## Description
2048 is a single-player puzzle game created in 2014 by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. It is played on a 4x4 grid of tiles, and the goal is to slide the tiles around to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

## How to play
The game is played with the arrow keys. Players can use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to slide the tiles around the grid. When two tiles with the same number touch, they will combine into one tile with a value equal to the sum of the two tiles. The game is won when a tile with the value 2048 is created, and it is lost when there are no more moves left and no more tiles can be combined.
